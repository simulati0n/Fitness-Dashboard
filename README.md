This fitness dashboard is a spring semester research project still in progress, expected to finish in May 2025. It involves communication with the Fitbit API to visualize health metrics for users.

The current focus is on the backend implementation of handling the logic to authenticate the user and gather data from the Fibit API.

Some of the upcoming features for deployment includes:
- adding more health metrics
- styling the site with CSS.
- using a server aside from Flask's default server
